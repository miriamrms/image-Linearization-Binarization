<h2>Image Linearization and Binarization</h2>

<h3>Challenge:</h3>
<p>Using preferably the same image from the exercises on high-pass and low-pass filters, convert the image to grayscale and display the result. Then, generate binary versions using thresholding:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Threshold of 30;</li>
  <li>Threshold of 150;</li>
  <li>Threshold of 200;</li>
  <li>Adaptive mean threshold;</li>
  <li>Adaptive Gaussian threshold.</li>
</ol>
<p>To facilitate visualization, plot the grayscale image and the binary images as a matrix with two rows and three columns, properly identifying the captions. What observations can you make?</p>
